# iNews
iNews is a project made for the Expo-Sciences 2020. It uses stance detection to guide the user into detecting fake and real news.
# Details
I created a deep learning model for stance detection achieving better performance than state of the art by applying **Word2vec** embeddings and **multi-channel convolutional architecture** and it was able to have a general accuracy of 85% compared to 82%.

Furthermore, I used **Python** and **BeautifulSoup** to scrape snopes and mediabiasfactcheck, websites that debunked fake news article and that verified the credibility of the source to display it on the dashboard. I also used **Google News API** to find similar articles to the one given and performed stance detection, showing a chart that described the proportion of articles who agreed or disagreed with the given article. 

The website was made using **React** and the backend was made using **Flask**
# Demo
Unfortunately, I decided to not deploy it given the cost for such compute. However, you can run it locally by following the steps below.

# Steps to run code

1. Execute setup for `web` folder
2. Execute setup for `backend` folder
