# iNews
iNews is a project made for the Expo-Sciences 2020. It uses stance detection to guide the user into detecting fake and real news.

### Steps to run code

1. Execute setup for `web` folder
2. Execute setup for `backend` folder
3. Make sure to disable CORS policy. I use [Moesif Cors Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc).
