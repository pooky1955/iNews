1. Introduction to the problem of fake news
  1. Statistics about fake news affecting
2. Initiatives taken to combat fake news
3. Shortfalls of these  approches
4. My approach 
  1. Why stance detection and not directly fact checking
  2. Introduction to the FNC-1 Dataset and the Fake News Challenge
  3. Overview of winners models
  4. Presentation of my model
    1. Justification of choices
      1. Why neural networks?
      2. Tfidf weights vs Word2vec
      3. Why convolutional neural networks
      4. Why create two models. One for classifiying if related or not, one for classying if it's agree, disagree, or discusses
  5. Comparison of performance between winners models and my model
  6. Introduction to FNC-ARC dataset
5. Shortfalls of my approach and how to solve them
  1. Add fact checking websites to my app
  2. Add source checking to my app
6. Conclusion
